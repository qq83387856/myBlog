The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see <a href="#Usage_notes" rel="internal">Notes</a> for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the <strong>cite</strong> attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite" title="The HTML Citation element (&lt;cite&gt;) is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must include the title of that work."><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code></a> element.
