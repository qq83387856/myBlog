The <strong><code>Float32Array</code></strong> typed array represents an array of 32-bit floating point numbers (corresponding to the C <code>float</code> data type) in the platform byte order. If control over byte order is needed, use <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView" title="The DataView view provides a low-level interface for reading and writing multiple number typesÂ in a binary ArrayBuffer, without having to care about the platform's endianness."><code>DataView</code></a> instead. The contents are initialized to <code>0</code>. Once established, you can reference elements in the array using the object's methods, or using standard array index syntax (that is, using bracket notation).
