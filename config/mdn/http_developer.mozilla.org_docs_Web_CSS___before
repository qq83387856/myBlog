In CSS, <strong><code>::before</code></strong> creates a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements">pseudo-element</a> that is the first child of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content" title="The content CSS property replaces an element with a generated value. Objects inserted using the content property are anonymous replaced elements."><code>content</code></a> property.
